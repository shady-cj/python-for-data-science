# Code challenge notebook: Loops and functions

## Introduction

The ultimate goal is to develop fully autonomous farming equipment. These machines will not just follow preset instructions; they will make intelligent decisions based on real-time data. Imagine tractors that know when to plough, seeders that understand the best planting patterns, and irrigation systems that water crops precisely when needed.

But every grand plan starts with a first step. For us, it's creating a digital mirror of Maji Ndogo's farming ecosystem - a comprehensive **Digital Twin**. This virtual model will be our testing ground. Here, we'll experiment with different agricultural strategies, analyse their outcomes, and perfect our approaches without a single seed being sown in the real world.

To build this digital farm, we'll rely on our Python programming skills. We’ll start by digitally constructing the farm elements:

- **Fields:** We'll create grid representations of fields where each cell is a patch of land.

- **Farming Equipment:** Digital tractors and tools will interact with the virtual crops and fields.

Let's gear up, roll up our sleeves, and dive in. 🌱🚜🌾
